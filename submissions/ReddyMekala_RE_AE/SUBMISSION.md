# Requested Badges
* Available: We believe our artifact deserves the Available badge because we have made it permanently and irrevocably available through Figshare (see below).
* Reusable: We have added a README.md and LICENSE.md. In the former, we have included the sections prescribed in the submission instructions. (Note: this request for the Reusable badge was made later, on 22 July 2021.)
